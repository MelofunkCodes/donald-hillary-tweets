# Donald-Hillary Tweets

A simple UI using React to show the latest tweets from Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.

Demo can be viewed here: 

A Node server was set-up with 
express.js to proxy the requests made to the Twitter API. The npm package `twitter` was used
to pass the oauth 1.0 params to the Twitter API and retrieve the tweets.
